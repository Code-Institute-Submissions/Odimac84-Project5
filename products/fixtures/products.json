Now you too can enjoy all your favorite games with a powerful graphics card that stays cool and silent. Just the way you like it. It’s time to put on team colors. Synchronize lighting with other compatible devices to take the light show to another level. Going dark is as easy as turning the lights off. WE KEEP IT COOL AND QUIET The TWIN FROZR 8 thermal system has been designed for efficiency. Expect a perfect balance of cool and quiet for more fun during endless gaming sessions. TORX FAN 4.0 is built on teamwork, with pairs of fan blades bound together with an outer ring design link that focuses airflow into the updated TWIN FROZR 8 cooling system. Core Pipes are precision-machined for maximum contact over the GPU and spread the heat along the full length of the heatsink for optimal cooling. Stay stealthy with Airflow Control that improves airflow dynamics. Deflectors provide additional surface area and guide air to where it’s needed for maximum cooling. Wave-curved 2.0 fin edges disrupt unwanted airflow harmonics resulting in reduced noise.",
